# DATA WAREHOUSE AND ANALYTICS PROJECT
Built an end-to-end data warehouse by integrating raw business data using ETL processes. Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables, cleaned and transformed data using SQL and Python, and created Power BI dashboards to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance.

 Data Architecture
 1.Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
 2.Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
 3.Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
