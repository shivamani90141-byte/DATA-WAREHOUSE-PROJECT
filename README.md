1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.


### 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

2. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
 
3. Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
 
4. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

Objective :

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications:

1. Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

2. Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

3. Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

4. Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

5. Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

Objective :

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

1. Customer Behavior

2. Product Performance

3. Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
