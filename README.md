# DATA WAREHOUSE AND ANALYTICS PROJECT
Built an end-to-end data warehouse by integrating raw business data using ETL processes. Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables, cleaned and transformed data using SQL, and created Power BI dashboards to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance.
